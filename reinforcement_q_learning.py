Reinforcement Learning (DQN) Tutorial
=====================================
**Author**: `Adam Paszke <https://github.com/apaszke>`_


This tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent
on the CartPole-v0 task from the `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`__.

**Task**

The agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or
right - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find an
official leaderboard with various algorithms and visualizations at the
`Gym website <https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0>`__.

As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses
an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also
returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this
task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment
terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more then 2.4
units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run
for longer duration, accumulating larger return.

The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real
values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).
However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the
scene, so we'll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an
input. Because of this, our results aren't directly comparable to the
ones from the official leaderboard - our task is much harder.
Unfortunately this does slow down the training, because we have to
render all the frames.

Strictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between
the current screen patch and the previous one. This will allow the agent
to take the velocity of the pole into account from one image.

**Packages**


First, let's import needed packages. Firstly, we need
`gym <https://gym.openai.com/docs>`__ for the environment
(Install using `pip install gym`).
We'll also use the following from PyTorch:

-  neural networks (``torch.nn``)
-  optimization (``torch.optim``)
-  automatic differentiation (``torch.autograd``)
-  utilities for vision tasks (``torchvision`` - `a separate
   package <https://github.com/pytorch/vision>`__).

# Replay Memory
# -------------
#
# We'll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN. It stores
# the transitions that the agent observes, allowing us to reuse this data
# later. By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a
# batch are decorrelated. It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes
# and improves the DQN training procedure.
#
# For this, we're going to need two classses:
#
# -  ``Transition`` - a named tuple representing a single transition in
#    our environment. It maps essentially maps (state, action) pairs
#    to their (next_state, reward) result, with the state being the
#    screen difference image as described later on.
# -  ``ReplayMemory`` - a cyclic buffer of bounded size that holds the
#    transitions observed recently. It also implements a ``.sample()``
#    method for selecting a random batch of transitions for training.
#

Transition = namedtuple('Transition',
                        ('state', 'action', 'next_state', 'reward'))

# Now, let's define our model. But first, let quickly recap what a DQN is.
#
# DQN algorithm
# -------------
#
# Our environment is deterministic, so all equations presented here are
# also formulated deterministically for the sake of simplicity. In the
# reinforcement learning literature, they would also contain expectations
# over stochastic transitions in the environment.
#
# Our aim will be to train a policy that tries to maximize the discounted,
# cumulative reward
# :math:`R_{t_0} = \sum_{t=t_0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t - t_0} r_t`, where
# :math:`R_{t_0}` is also known as the *return*. The discount,
# :math:`\gamma`, should be a constant between :math:`0` and :math:`1`
# that ensures the sum converges. It makes rewards from the uncertain far
# future less important for our agent than the ones in the near future
# that it can be fairly confident about.
#
# The main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a function
# :math:`Q^*: State \times Action \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`, that could tell
# us what our return would be, if we were to take an action in a given
# state, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our
# rewards:
#
# .. math:: \pi^*(s) = \arg\!\max_a \ Q^*(s, a)
#
# However, we don't know everything about the world, so we don't have
# access to :math:`Q^*`. But, since neural networks are universal function
# approximators, we can simply create one and train it to resemble
# :math:`Q^*`.
#
# For our training update rule, we'll use a fact that every :math:`Q`
# function for some policy obeys the Bellman equation:
#
# .. math:: Q^{\pi}(s, a) = r + \gamma Q^{\pi}(s', \pi(s'))
#
# The difference between the two sides of the equality is known as the
# temporal difference error, :math:`\delta`:
#
# .. math:: \delta = Q(s, a) - (r + \gamma \max_a Q(s', a))
#
# To minimise this error, we will use the `Huber
# loss <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss>`__. The Huber loss acts
# like the mean squared error when the error is small, but like the mean
# absolute error when the error is large - this makes it more robust to
# outliers when the estimates of :math:`Q` are very noisy. We calculate
# this over a batch of transitions, :math:`B`, sampled from the replay
# memory:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{|B|}\sum_{(s, a, s', r) \
#                    \in \ B} \mathcal{L}(\delta)
#
# .. math::
#
#    \text{where} \quad \mathcal{L}(\delta) = \begin{cases}
#      \frac{1}{2}{\delta^2}  & \text{for } |\delta| \le 1, \\
#      |\delta| - \frac{1}{2} & \text{otherwise.}
#    \end{cases}
#
# Q-network
# ^^^^^^^^^
#
# Our model will be a convolutional neural network that takes in the
# difference between the current and previous screen patches. It has two
# outputs, representing :math:`Q(s, \mathrm{left})` and
# :math:`Q(s, \mathrm{right})` (where :math:`s` is the input to the
# network). In effect, the network is trying to predict the *expected return*
# of taking each action given the current input.

#    along with an average over the last 100 episodes (the measure used in
#    the official evaluations). The plot will be underneath the cell
#    containing the main training loop, and will update after every
